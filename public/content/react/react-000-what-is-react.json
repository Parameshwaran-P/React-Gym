Nothing more.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 Life Before React (The Problem)\n\nImagine you write a number on a board:\n\n> Count: 0\n\nNow every time the number changes:\n- You erase it\n- You write a new number\n\nYou must remember **where** to erase and **where** to write.\n\nThis is how websites worked before React.\n\n---\n\n## 😖 Why This Was Painful\n\n- Developers manually changed the screen\n- Missed some places\n- UI broke easily\n- Bugs appeared everywhere\n\nDevelopers were **afraid to touch working code**."
