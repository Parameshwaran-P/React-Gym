Your app must support:\n\n- Patient management (admit, discharge, update status)\n- Doctor and nurse dashboards\n- Wards, departments, and multiple floors\n- Protected routes for roles (admin, doctor, nurse)\n- Real-time updates and notifications\n- Lazy-loaded dashboards for performance\n- Error handling for robust UX\n- Testing for critical workflows\n\nThink of this as your **capstone project** — combining **all lessons into a real app**."
